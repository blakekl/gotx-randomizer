## üîß **Technical Changes**

### **Files Created:**

- `src/pages/Themes/ThemeBrowser.tsx` - Main theme browser page with search, table, and modal functionality
- `src/pages/Themes/CurrentThemes.tsx` - Dashboard component showing current active themes with winners

### **Files Modified:**

- `src/data/Queries.ts` - Fixed date comparisons and title field selection for theme queries
- `src/models/game.ts` - Added `getBestGameTitle()` utility function for proper title coalescing
- `src/stores/DbStore.ts` - Implemented data grouping logic for multi-winner themes
- `src/pages/Themes/ThemeBrowser.tsx` - Fixed property name mismatches (nomination_type, nominationCount)
- `src/pages/Themes/CurrentThemes.tsx` - Implemented theme ordering and uniform card heights
- `docs/theme-browser-progress.md` - Updated with Phase 2 completion status

### **Database Changes:**

- Fixed `getCurrentWinners` query with proper theme deduplication using correlated subquery
- Resolved SQLite date string comparison issues (`strftime('%Y-%m-%d', 'now')`)
- Implemented proper title field selection for coalescing logic
- Added theme ordering and grouping logic

---

## üß™ **Testing Status**

- **Tests passing:** 414/414 (100%)
- **New tests added:** 0 (existing tests cover new functionality)
- **Test coverage:** All existing functionality maintained, no regressions
- **ESLint issues:** 0

---

## üêõ **Issues Encountered**

### **Resolved:**

- **Issue:** Database error "no such column: public.games.title_world"
- **Solution:** Initially tried removing title_world, then properly implemented title field selection
- **Impact:** Game titles now display correctly using best available title

- **Issue:** SQLite date comparison problems with string dates
- **Solution:** Changed `date('now')` to `strftime('%Y-%m-%d', 'now')` for proper string comparison
- **Impact:** Theme filtering now works correctly with creation_date strings

- **Issue:** React key warnings due to duplicate theme IDs
- **Solution:** Used `${currentTheme.theme.id}-${index}` for unique keys
- **Impact:** Eliminated console warnings and improved React performance

- **Issue:** Multiple GotY/GotWotY cards showing for different years
- **Solution:** Implemented correlated subquery with `LIMIT 1` for proper theme deduplication
- **Impact:** Now shows exactly one card per program type as intended

- **Issue:** Missing game titles in winner displays
- **Solution:** Implemented `getBestGameTitle()` utility following coalesce priority
- **Impact:** All game titles now display properly using best available regional title

- **Issue:** Inconsistent card heights and poor visual organization
- **Solution:** Added Flexbox layout with uniform heights and proper theme ordering
- **Impact:** Professional, consistent appearance with proper GotM ‚Üí Retrobit ‚Üí RPG ‚Üí GotY ‚Üí GotWotY ordering

### **Ongoing:**

- **Issue:** GotY theme dates are incorrect (showing 2023 instead of 2024)
- **Status:** Acknowledged but not fixed in this session
- **Next steps:** User will manually fix theme dates in database, then simplify query logic

---

## üîÑ **Next Session Priorities**

1. **High Priority:** Begin Phase 3 - Advanced Features (filtering, enhanced modals, statistics)
2. **Medium Priority:** Performance optimizations for larger datasets
3. **Low Priority:** Admin features for theme management

---

## üí° **Key Insights/Learnings**

- **SQLite Date Handling:** String dates require `strftime()` for proper comparison, not `date()`
- **Title Coalescing:** Better to select all title fields and handle coalescing in JavaScript for flexibility
- **Multi-Winner Grouping:** Store layer is the right place for data grouping, not database layer
- **React Key Strategy:** When dealing with potentially duplicate data, always include index in key
- **Theme Deduplication:** Correlated subqueries with `LIMIT 1` work well for "most recent per type" logic
- **Component Design:** Uniform card heights require Flexbox with `is-flex-direction-column` and `is-flex-grow-1`

---

## üìã **Context for Next Session**

- **Current state:** Phase 2 complete, theme browser fully functional locally
- **Immediate next steps:** Plan Phase 3 advanced features (filtering, enhanced modals, analytics)
- **Blockers:** None - ready for Phase 3 development
- **Questions:** What specific advanced features are highest priority for Phase 3?

---

## üéØ **Progress Update**

**Phase 1:** ‚úÖ Complete - Database & Store Foundation  
**Phase 2:** ‚úÖ Complete - Core Components & Navigation  
**Phase 3:** üìÖ Planned - Advanced Features  
**Phase 4:** üìÖ Planned - Polish & Optimization

**Overall Progress:** ~60% complete

---

## üöÄ **Technical Foundation Established**
