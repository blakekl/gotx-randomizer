## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions:**

- **Extend existing infrastructure** rather than create separate systems
- **Follow established patterns** from Games page and existing components
- **Multi-winner support** built into data structures from the start
- **Privacy-first approach** with database-level filtering for upcoming themes

### **Business Logic Decisions:**

- **GotM themes**: Support up to 3 winners (one per year category)
- **GotY themes**: Group multiple award categories by year (same creation_date)
- **Privacy handling**: Hide upcoming theme titles at database query level
- **Year categorization**: Use existing logic with theme_id 235 boundary

---

## 📊 **Metrics & Testing**

### **Test Coverage:**

- **Current:** 406 tests passing
- **Target:** Maintain 100% pass rate, add tests for new functionality

### **Performance Targets:**

- **Page load:** < 2 seconds (match existing pages)
- **Filtering:** < 500ms response time
- **Mobile:** Smooth experience on all devices

## 🔄 **Recent Session Notes**

### **Session: August 20, 2025**

**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Project analysis, documentation, and planning

**Accomplishments:**

- Analyzed existing codebase and identified 70% reusable infrastructure
- Created comprehensive database schema documentation
- Developed detailed master plan with UI mockups and implementation phases
- Clarified multi-winner business rules for GotM and GotY programs
- Established development patterns and context documentation

**Key Insights:**

- Theme interface already exists - major time saver
- Year categorization logic changes at theme_id 235
- Privacy requirements are strict - upcoming theme titles must never be exposed
- GotM has 3 winners per theme (by year category)
- GotY has multiple themes per year (award categories)

**Next Session Goals:**

- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Extend database queries and interfaces
- Set up basic theme store functionality

---

## 📋 **Context for Future Sessions**

### **Always Remember:**

- **Privacy is critical** - upcoming theme titles must NEVER be exposed
- **Multi-winner support** - GotM (3 winners), GotY (multiple categories)
- **Year logic changes at theme_id 235** - different category boundaries
- **Follow existing patterns** - 70% of infrastructure already exists
- **Test everything** - maintain 406 test pass rate

### **Quick Start Context:**

1. We're building a theme browser for the GotX Randomizer
2. Currently on `feature/theme-browser` branch
3. All planning and documentation is complete
4. Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Focus on extending existing database infrastructure first

### **Files to Reference:**

- `docs/masterplan.md` - Complete feature specification
- `docs/database-schema.md` - Database structure and relationships
- `docs/project-context.md` - Business rules and constraints
- `docs/codebase-patterns.md` - Development patterns to follow
