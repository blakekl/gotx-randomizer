## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Decisions:**

- **Extend existing infrastructure** rather than create separate systems
- **Follow established patterns** from Games page and existing components
- **Multi-winner support** built into data structures from the start
- **Privacy-first approach** with database-level filtering for upcoming themes

### **Business Logic Decisions:**

- **GotM themes**: Support up to 3 winners (one per year category)
- **GotY themes**: Group multiple award categories by year (same creation_date)
- **Privacy handling**: Hide upcoming theme titles at database query level
- **Year categorization**: Use existing logic with theme_id 235 boundary

---

## 📊 **Metrics & Testing**

### **Test Coverage:**

- **Current:** 406 tests passing
- **Target:** Maintain 100% pass rate, add tests for new functionality

### **Performance Targets:**

- **Page load:** < 2 seconds (match existing pages)
- **Filtering:** < 500ms response time
- **Mobile:** Smooth experience on all devices

**Focus:** Phase 1 & 2 implementation completion

**Accomplishments:**

**Phase 1 Completion:**

- Extended `src/data/Queries.ts` with 7 new theme queries
- Added 6 new interfaces and 3 new DTOs to `src/models/game.ts`
- Implemented 7 new database client methods in `src/data/initDbClient.ts`
- All database methods follow established patterns
- Privacy filtering implemented at database level

**Phase 2 Completion:**

- Created `src/pages/Themes/` directory structure
- Built `ThemeBrowser.tsx` with search, table display, and modal functionality
- Created `CurrentThemes.tsx` with card-based dashboard layout
- Added `/themes` route to main routing configuration
- Added "Themes" navigation link to Navigation.tsx
- Fixed ESLint compliance issues (unused variables, type safety)
- **Critical Fix:** Resolved React warnings by updating mock settings store in test-utils

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- All 406 tests passing with no regressions
- No React warnings or console errors
- Components follow established patterns from Games page
- Proper empty state and loading scenario handling
- Multi-winner support built into component architecture
- ESLint strict type checking compliance maintained

**Critical Issue Resolved:**

- **React Warnings:** Fixed "checked prop without onChange handler" warnings by updating mock settings store in `test-utils.tsx` to include all SettingsStore properties and methods
